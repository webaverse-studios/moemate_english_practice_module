This is the correct answer because the sentence is describing an action that took place in the past (yesterday) and is completed, so the simple past tense is needed.\nA) will walk is incorrect because it is the future tense, referring to an action that will take place in the future.\nC) had walked is the past perfect tense, used to describe an action that was completed before another past action. It does not fit here.\nD) have walked is the present perfect tense, used to describe an action that started in the past but continues to or impacts the present. It does not fit the timeframe of the sentence.\nThe simple past tense \"walked\" is the only option that properly conveys that the action took place entirely in the past.",
